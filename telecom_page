**Project description:** Improving Telecom's Low Retention Rate to Maximize Revenue via Marketing Tactics

### 1. The Dataset

<h1>TOOL: Tableau, Python (seaborn, matplotlib)</h1>

<h2>DATA: profile of customer base (basic demographic variables, payment methods, individual services, add-ons, tenure, churn)</h2>

A mentor from my data analyst bootcamp recommended this dataset to me, as I was having difficulty finding a dataset with enough lines to justify using
python (oddly enough!).  I think he thought I was a data science student because it lends itself to logistic regression (or something like that - the 
dependent variable was churn as a 1 or a 0) and has no cost data, price data, or time series data, making it difficult to figure out what to analyze beyond
taking averages of various variables.  Anyway, the dataset: 

<b>gender</b>:  Male, Female
<b>SeniorCitizen</b>:  0, 1

tenure	
PhoneService

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
